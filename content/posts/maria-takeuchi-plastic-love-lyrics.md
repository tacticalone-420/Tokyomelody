title   : 'Maria Takeuchi Plastic Love Lyrics'
description : "Plastic Love by Mariya Takeuchi is one of the most iconic city pop songs of all time. Released in 1984 as part of her album Variety, the song blends smooth jazz, soft rock, and nostalgic melodies, creating a dreamy and melancholic atmosphere. Its lyrics tell the story of a woman reminiscing about a past love that felt real but was ultimately fleeting—just like plastic love. Over the years, the song has gained worldwide recognition, especially through YouTube, becoming a symbol of the city pop revival and Japanese 80s aesthetics"

| 突然のキスや熱いまなざしで | Totsuzen no kisu ya atsui manazashi de | With a sudden kiss and a passionate gaze
| 恋のプログラムを狂わせないでね | Koi no puroguramu o kuruwasenai de ne | Don't throw my love program off balance
| 出逢いと別れ上手に打ち込んで | Deai to wakare jouzu ni uchikonde | Skillfully typing in meetings and farewells
| 時間がくれば終わる don't hurry! | Jikan ga kureba owaru don't hurry! | When the time comes, it will end—don't hurry!
| 愛に傷ついたあの日からずっと | Ai ni kizutsuita ano hi kara zutto | Ever since the day I was hurt by love
| 昼と夜が逆の暮らしを続けて | Hiru to yoru ga gyaku no kurashi o tsudzukete | I've been living with days and nights reversed
| はやりの disco で踊り明かすうちに | Hayari no disco de odori akasu uchi ni | As I dance the night away at a trendy disco
| おぼえた魔術なのよ I'm sorry! | Oboeta majutsu na no yo I'm sorry! | I've learned a kind of magic—I'm sorry!
| 私のことを決して本気で愛さないで | Watashi no koto o kesshite honki de aisanai de | Never fall in love with me seriously
| 恋なんてただのゲーム | Koi nante tada no geemu | Love is just a game
| 楽しめばそれでいいの | Tanoshimeba sore de ii no | As long as you enjoy it, that's enough
| 閉ざした心を飾る | Tozashita kokoro o kazaru | Decorating my closed heart
| 派手なドレスも靴も 孤独な友だち | Hade na doresu mo kutsu mo kodoku na tomodachi | Flashy dresses and shoes—lonely companions
| 私を誘う人は皮肉なものね | Watashi o sasou hito wa hiniku na mono ne | The people who invite me—how ironic
| いつも彼に似てるわ | Itsumo kare ni niteru wa | They always look like him
| なぜか思い出と重なり合う | Naze ka omoide to kasanariau | Somehow overlapping with my memories
| グラスを落として急に涙ぐんでも | Gurasu o otoshite kyuu ni namidagunde mo | Even if I suddenly drop my glass and tear up
| わけは尋ねないでね | Wake wa tazunenaide ne | Don't ask me why
| 夜更けの高速で眠りにつくころ | Yofuke no kousoku de nemuri ni tsuku koro | As I fall asleep on the late-night highway
| ハロゲンライトだけ妖しく輝く | Harogen raito dake ayashiku kagayaku | Only the halogen lights glow mysteriously
| 氷のように冷たい女だと | Koori no you ni tsumetai onna da to | They whisper that I'm a woman as cold as ice
| ささやく声がしても don't worry! | Sasayaku koe ga shite mo don't worry! | Even if I hear those whispers, don't worry!
| I'm just playing games
| I know that's plastic love
| Dance to the plastic beat
| Another morning comes
