| I just dance in the sweet memories  
| (He's my one and only, You never can tell)  
| I just dance in the sweet memories  
| (Sweet memories)  
| 雪が踊るホ－ムへ | Yuki ga odoru hōmu e | To the platform where the snow dances  
| 息を切らして驅けて來る | Iki wo kirashite kakete kuru | Running breathlessly  
| 遠い日のステ－ション | Tōi hi no sutēshon | A station from a distant day  
| 會えない日日が寫眞のように | Aenai hibi ga shashin no yō ni | The days we can't meet, like a photograph  
| アナタを微笑みに變えたの | Anata wo hohoemi ni kaeta no | Have turned you into a smile  
| I just dance in the sweet memories  
| 傷ついて愛し方を | Kizutsuite aishikata wo | Hurt and learning how to love  
| I just dance in the sweet memories  
| 覺えて行くのね | Oboete yuku no ne | I guess you’re learning to remember it  
| もうしばらくはきっと | Mou shibaraku wa kitto | Surely, for a little while longer  
| 夢の中をさまようでしょう | Yume no naka wo samayou deshou | I will probably wander in a dream  
| 地圖さえも持たず | Chizu sae mo motazu | Without even carrying a map  
| 今ならわかる | Ima nara wakaru | Now I understand  
| アナタの背中の意味が | Anata no senaka no imi ga | The meaning of your back  
| だけど屆かないわ | Dakedo todokanai wa | But I can't reach you  
| I just dance in the sweet memories  
| 傷つけて愛し方を | Kizutsukete aishikata wo | Hurting and learning how to love  
| I just dance in the sweet memories  
| 覺えて行くのね | Oboete yuku no ne | I guess you’re learning to remember it  
| 曇りガラスの心のドアを開いて | Kumori garasu no kokoro no doa wo hiraite | Opening the frosted glass door of my heart  
| 翼をくれた人 | Tsubasa wo kureta hito | The person who gave me wings  
| I just dance in the sweet memories  
| きらめきを忘れないわ | Kirameki wo wasurenai wa | I won’t forget the sparkle  
| I just dance in the sweet memories  
| 夢から醒めても | Yume kara sametemo | Even after waking from the dream  
| I just dance in the sweet memories  
| きらめきを忘れないわ | Kirameki wo wasurenai wa | I won’t forget the sparkle  
| I just dance in the sweet memories  
| 夢から醒めても | Yume kara sametemo | Even after waking from the dream  
| I just dance in the sweet memories  
| (Every time I think of you, I'm missing the days)  
| I just dance in the sweet memories  
| (Sweet memories)  
| I just dance in the sweet memories  
| (He's my one and only, You never can tell)  
| I just dance in the sweet memories  
| (Sweet memories)
